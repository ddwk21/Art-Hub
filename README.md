# Art-Hub
Art-hub is an application created to provide users with an endless experience. Users will scroll down the page and be shown over 500,000 pieces of art from many eras and mediums. Art-Hub features artwork from the Metropolitan Museum of Art as well as Harvard Art Museums. Users will be able to hover over an image and be presented with information such as: title of the artwork, name of the artist, creator's contribution to the artwork, era the artwork was created, the culture the artwork comes from, and the medium the art is crafted from. Users will be able to keep track of art that they enjoy by clicking the image's like button.

## Motivation
Our motivation for this project was to create an application that is a healthier as well as educational alternative for the inevitable "doom-scroll". 

## User Story
As a user that loves art, I want to be able to scroll through an endless feed of art pieces from many eras and cultures. When I enjoy a piece of art, I want to be able to click like on that image so that I can view it later. 


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN an application that displays art
<br>
WHEN I scroll down the page
<br>
THEN I am presented with a randomly generated piece of art
<br>
WHEN I hover over an image
<br>
THEN I am presented with information about the artist, culture, era, medium
<br>
WHEN I click the like button on an image
