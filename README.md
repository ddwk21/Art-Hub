# Art-Hub
Art-hub is an application created to provide users with an endless experience. Users will scroll down the page and be shown over 500,000 pieces of art from many eras and mediums. Art-Hub features artwork from the Metropolitan Museum of Art as well as Harvard Art Museums. Users will be able to hover over an image and be presented with information such as: title of the artwork, name of the artist, creator's contribution to the artwork, era the artwork was created, the culture the artwork comes from, and the medium the art is crafted from. Users will be able to keep track of art that they enjoy by clicking the image's like button.
